Build and Run Instructions:

Prepare Your Project Directory:

Create a new directory (e.g., BenignMalwareSample).
Place your source file (main.c) containing the advanced example into this directory.
Create a file named CMakeLists.txt in the same directory and copy the contents provided above into it.
Generate the Build Files:

Open a terminal (or use the Developer Command Prompt on Windows if you’re using MSVC).
Navigate to your project directory:

cd path/to/BenignMalwareSample
Create a build directory and change into it:

mkdir build
cd build
Run CMake to generate the project files:

cmake ..
Note: If you are using a specific generator (e.g., Visual Studio), you can specify it with the -G option (for example, cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..).
Build the Project:

After CMake has generated the build system, compile the project:

cmake --build .
This command will compile your source code and create the executable benign_sample (or benign_sample.exe on Windows).
Run the Executable:

In your build directory, run the program:
On Windows:

benign_sample.exe
On Linux or macOS (if you adapted the code accordingly):

./benign_sample
Educational Lab Context:

Environment: Ensure you run this project in a controlled lab environment (such as isolated virtual machines like Kali Linux, FLARE VM, and REMnux) if you’re demonstrating reverse-engineering or malware analysis techniques.
Analysis: Have your students document their build, execution, and any observations they make during dynamic and static analysis.
Discussion: Encourage students to discuss how the anti-disassembly, anti-debugging, and self-modifying code techniques work. They should also consider ethical considerations and the importance of safe lab practices when working with such code.
